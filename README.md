# boinc_scripts
A collection of scripts to batch manage multiple projects from the commandline.

The scripts are as follows:

- Bash script, you can source it into your shell, then the boinc_ commands can be used to do batch operations on all specified projects

- Python library. A WIP for allowing integration into other python programs/scripts
